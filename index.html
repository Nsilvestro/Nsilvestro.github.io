<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Self-Assessment:</h2>
<p>I started this degree with little to no knowledge about computer science. I was making a career change, and I was out of my element. As each semester progressed, I felt more and more comfortable and confident with my ability to not only meet but exceed all requirements on each project. In developing this ePortfolio, I aim to demonstrate the skills and strengths I have gained in various advanced concepts.
</p>
<p>Specific artifacts highlight a variety of coding standards and best practices as well as deeper topics. The creation of coursework throughout the program, and more specifically enhancing these creations throughout the portfolio, has showcased learning in embedded systems, data structures, and databases. Additionally coding best practices and a security mindset have been adopted regardless of setting.
</p>
<p>There are a few overarching skillsets adopted that do not directly relate to just one coding project. This includes skills such as collaborating in a team environment as well as communicating with various team members effectively. The ability to collaborate in a team environment is an imperative skill to success. Throughout a variety of differing project management methodologies there is a consistent undertone present: a confluence of people with various backgrounds and disciplines. This persistent fact places an importance upon this skill that transcends individual organizations or project management styles. The act of communicating with stakeholders highlights another important skill. This skill is underpinned with the ability to recognize various groups’ interests apart from your own. An ability to communicate clearly and an openness to feedback are necessary. This skill therefore also speaks broadly on one’s ability to convey technical information to non-technical audiences.
</p>
<p>Software engineering principles/best practices and security encompass more overarching principles, although more directly focused on specific coding projects. Security is at the forefront of development and a continual evolving thought. Reviewing data structures and algorithms in regard to designing and solving a solution to a problem involves managing trade-offs and ultimately having a keen understanding of the client’s needs. These trade-offs can be given metrics for comparisons and selections to be made, such as runtimes, costs, etc. 
</p>
<p>The artifacts selected for this repository were chosen as they culminate into an exemplar of all these relevant skills. Specifically, the artifacts chosen for the software design and engineering and the algorithms and data structures/databases categories were an embedded smart thermostat and a course planner program respectively.
</p>
<p>The first artifact reflected on the skills gained through one of my more recent courses; Emerging systems. Selecting this artifact and utilizing embedded systems, peripherals and tools, and coding techniques (i.e. a task scheduler) to enhance the product, showcased the ability to use techniques and tools to design and develop exemplary solutions. A deeper understanding of embedded systems is displayed through thorough code enhancement, representing a skillset more pertinent to today’s increase in IoT devices. Coding standards and best practices are highlighted through consistency, detailed documentation and readability, maintainability, and reusability.
</p>
<p>The second artifact showcased strong skill sets in a variety of categories through various enhancements. Originally, the Course Planner was developed roughly halfway through this degree. The first enhancement reflected on a deliberation of factors and a selection of an algorithm data structure, underlying structure, and the creation of an algorithm to support the use of the structure. In doing so, it showcases the ability to design and use algorithmic principles while evaluating solutions and managing trade-offs. This enhancement also demonstrates a strong understanding of security concepts. The second enhancement dives deeper into the inclusion and improvements made through the use of database concepts, showcasing innovative techniques for the purpose of implementing a solution that will deliver a higher value product. Demonstrating the understanding of various database libraries and the selection of SQLite to meet specific system requirements while implementing data manipulation functionality highlights advanced understanding of database concepts.
