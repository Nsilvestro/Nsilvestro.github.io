<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Self-Assessment:</h2>
<p>I started this degree with little to no knowledge about computer science. I was making a career change, and I was out of my element. As each semester progressed, I felt more and more comfortable and confident with my ability to not only meet but exceed all requirements on each project. In developing this ePortfolio, I aim to demonstrate the skills and strengths I have gained in various advanced concepts.
</p>
<p>Specific artifacts highlight a variety of coding standards and best practices as well as deeper topics. The creation of coursework throughout the program, and more specifically enhancing these creations throughout the portfolio, has showcased learning in embedded systems, data structures, and databases. Additionally coding best practices and a security mindset have been adopted regardless of setting.
</p>
<p>There are a few overarching skillsets adopted that do not directly relate to just one coding project. This includes skills such as collaborating in a team environment as well as communicating with various team members effectively. The ability to collaborate in a team environment is an imperative skill to success. Throughout a variety of differing project management methodologies there is a consistent undertone present: a confluence of people with various backgrounds and disciplines. This persistent fact places an importance upon this skill that transcends individual organizations or project management styles. The act of communicating with stakeholders highlights another important skill. This skill is underpinned with the ability to recognize various groups’ interests apart from your own. An ability to communicate clearly and an openness to feedback are necessary. This skill therefore also speaks broadly on one’s ability to convey technical information to non-technical audiences.
</p>
<p>Software engineering principles/best practices and security encompass more overarching principles, although more directly focused on specific coding projects. Security is at the forefront of development and a continual evolving thought. Reviewing data structures and algorithms in regard to designing and solving a solution to a problem involves managing trade-offs and ultimately having a keen understanding of the client’s needs. These trade-offs can be given metrics for comparisons and selections to be made, such as runtimes, costs, etc. 
</p>
<p>The artifacts selected for this repository were chosen as they culminate into an exemplar of all these relevant skills. Specifically, the artifacts chosen for the software design and engineering and the algorithms and data structures/databases categories were an embedded smart thermostat and a course planner program respectively.
</p>
<p>The first artifact reflected on the skills gained through one of my more recent courses; Emerging systems. Selecting this artifact and utilizing embedded systems, peripherals and tools, and coding techniques (i.e. a task scheduler) to enhance the product, showcased the ability to use techniques and tools to design and develop exemplary solutions. A deeper understanding of embedded systems is displayed through thorough code enhancement, representing a skillset more pertinent to today’s increase in IoT devices. Coding standards and best practices are highlighted through consistency, detailed documentation and readability, maintainability, and reusability.
</p>
<p>The second artifact showcased strong skill sets in a variety of categories through various enhancements. Originally, the Course Planner was developed roughly halfway through this degree. The first enhancement reflected on a deliberation of factors and a selection of an algorithm data structure, underlying structure, and the creation of an algorithm to support the use of the structure. In doing so, it showcases the ability to design and use algorithmic principles while evaluating solutions and managing trade-offs. This enhancement also demonstrates a strong understanding of security concepts. The second enhancement dives deeper into the inclusion and improvements made through the use of database concepts, showcasing innovative techniques for the purpose of implementing a solution that will deliver a higher value product. Demonstrating the understanding of various database libraries and the selection of SQLite to meet specific system requirements while implementing data manipulation functionality highlights advanced understanding of database concepts.

<h2>Category One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
<h3>Artifact Description:</h3>
<p>The artifact in use is the final project from the emerging systems architecture and technologies course. This project was created as an example of the embedded systems knowledge gained. The code in the project was intended to create and prototype an embedded system smart thermostat. Through the use of peripherals, a current temperature would be sensed, compared with a setpoint temperature, and if necessary, the LED would light (indicating a heating system turning on). Two buttons on the TI board were used to manipulate the setpoint temperature.
</p>
<h3>Inclusion:</h3>
<p>This artifact was selected for inclusion in the ePortfolio as experience with programming for embedded systems appeared to be a self-promoting skillset, especially with pertinence to IoT devices.
Within the artifact, improvements to the code’s efficiency through exchanging the current conditional statements for a task scheduler as well as generally altering the code to conform to code review improvements will showcase an ability to deliver a product that accomplishes industry specific goals (such as a smart thermostat that simulates data being sent to a server via WIFI).
</p>
<h3>Enhancement Process:</h3>
<p>Pin configuration: In attempting to make the main functional enhancement, the AC counterpart to the current heating system prototype, I was able to learn more about the hardware itself. In configuring the hardware and pins for peripheral objects, I found that you are rather limited by the pins available on the board. Multiple LEDs have been used successfully in previous work: using pulse width modulation (PWM) to create morse code messages using two LEDs and using GPIO with two LEDs. In the former PWM example, the LEDs were configured using the I2C pin. In the latter GPIO example, the red LED has a pin available for selection in pin configuration (P64/29). Neither the yellow nor green LEDs have a similar option under GPIO pin configuration (although both have a hardware option). In order to use a second LED with the red LED in the past using GPIO, the second LED pin was configured as the I2C pin (P02/10) as well. In the previous projects the I2C peripheral was not in use, whereas in this project it is integral. The workarounds I was able to research involved more hardware, such as a GPIO expander or PWM controller. A seemingly simple approach to configuring a logically similar but opposite AC counterpart to the heat system functionality would require additional hardware and hardware integration that would be outside of the scope of this software category.
Task Scheduler: As part of the enhancements for this project, I implemented the use of a task scheduler to increase efficiency. In order to accomplish this, I created a structure to hold relevant attributes (such as task period, elapsed time, and task function) of a task (button checking, comparing temperatures, and outputting data) in the program. Additionally, a task initializer function and a task scheduler function were created to populate the tasks and their attributes, and to handle the main task scheduler for loop. This involved moving repetitive local variables throughout the code to global variable scope and decreasing the overall amount of declared variables. This also involved creating individual task functions with respective functionality. One issue encountered was when calling the task functions in the task scheduler function originally. After researching and experimenting around the error, I defined a function type and used this type in the overall task structure to resolve the issue. Ultimately this implementation increased the efficiency of the code, while decreasing the overall amount of repetitive code in the main function.
