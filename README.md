The self assessment found in the portfolio details relevant strengths, goals, and values. Additionally, the artifacts included in the protfolio are introduced. 
## Code Review
Original Artifacts:
1. [Embedded Smart Thermostat](https://github.com/Nsilvestro/Nsilvestro.github.io/tree/main/Original%20Artifacts/Artifact%20One/gpiointerrupt_CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_nortos_gcc)
2. [Course Planner](https://github.com/Nsilvestro/Nsilvestro.github.io/tree/main/Original%20Artifacts/Artifact%20Two/CoursePlanner)

Included in the portfolio is a recorded code review. The review for each artifact includes a walkthrough of existing functionality, an analysis of the code, as well as identification of areas for enhancements. The artifacts listed above are the ones detailed in the code review video.

A transcript of the video review can be found under the file titled code review script. 

## Enhancements
Narratives are included for each category of enhancment. The narratives focus on a description of each artifact, a justification on the inclusion of each artifact, and a reflection on the enhancement process.
